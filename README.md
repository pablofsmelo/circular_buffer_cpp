# circular_buffer_cpp

This project includes a circular buffer implementation in C++. 

A circular buffer, also known as a ring buffer, is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This is useful for buffering data streams and when you have a producer-consumer scenario.

## Usage Example
To use the CircularBuffer class, you need to instantiate an object of the class and then use the provided methods to add and remove elements from the buffer. Below is a simple example:

```
#include "circular_buffer.h"

int main() {
    CircularBuffer cb;
    int data[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    if (cb.Enqueue(data, 5)) {
        cout << "Data enqueued successfully!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Failed to enqueue data." << endl;
    }

    int output[5];
    if (cb.Dequeue(output, 5)) {
        cout << "Data dequeued successfully: ";
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
            cout << output[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Failed to dequeue data." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Portability
This circular buffer implementation is designed to be portable across different systems and platforms. Here are a few key points ensuring its portability:

### Standard C++ Libraries:

The implementation uses standard C++ libraries, making it compatible with any C++ compiler that adheres to the standard.

- Minimal Dependencies:
The code has minimal dependencies on external libraries and is self-contained, which simplifies porting to various systems.

- Platform Independence:
The code avoids platform-specific features and system calls, making it suitable for embedded systems, desktop applications, and server environments.

- Configurable Buffer Size:
The buffer size can be adjusted by modifying the BUFFER_SIZE macro definition, allowing it to be tailored to the specific needs of different applications and systems.

To use this implementation in different environments:

### Embedded Systems:
Ensure that the target platform supports C++.
Adjust the BUFFER_SIZE macro based on the memory constraints of the embedded system.
Integrate the CircularBuffer class into the embedded software project, ensuring it is compiled with the rest of the code.

### Desktop Applications:
Include the circular_buffer.h header and corresponding source file in your project.
Use a standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) to compile the code.

### Server Environments:
Similar to desktop applications, ensure the code is included in the server project.
Compile using a compatible C++ compiler available on the server.
By adhering to these principles, the CircularBuffer class can be easily integrated and used across a wide range of systems and platforms, from small embedded devices to large-scale server applications.
